## Welcome!

MLCoLearn is a bi-weekly meet-up in Bonn for researchers working on neuroscience problems using (or interested in using) machine learning methods.

This repository hosts our Pages site, where the meet-up schedule can be found [here](https://mlcolearn.github.io/), as well as code developed during meet-up sessions. 

If you are interested in joining and would like to know more, get in touch with us by email: ```alana.darcher (at) ukbonn.de```.
